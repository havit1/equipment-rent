- In ProductList.jsx all info about every product is loaded.
Need to add smth like shortinformation in database and show it.

- In ProductPage and ProductList same requests to the database are made,
but after fixing ^ that ^ this is also gonna be changed.
  
    Reason: unnecessary information always stored in the store.

- When possible - add searchBar and change usersSavedProduct action and reducer to save only productId (and maybe product's category for easier search proccess)
and then search for it on Saved Products page instead of saving the whole product object.
